-- #SYNONYM

/*

A synonym is merely another name for a table or a view. Synonyms are usually created so a user 
can avoid having to qualify another userâ€™s table or view to access the table or view. 
Synonyms can be created as PUBLIC or PRIVATE. Any user of the database can use a PUBLIC synonym;
only the owner of a database and any users that have been granted privileges can use a PRIVATE synonym.

All users can generally create a PRIVATE synonym. Typically, only a DBA or privileged database user can create a PUBLIC synonym.
